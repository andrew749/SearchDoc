# SearchDoc

Search documentation for a specific langauge.

Supports the same documentation formats that [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) and [Zeal](http://zealdocs.org) do.


## Usage

```
searchdoc QUERY [--language=LANG] [--method] [--class]
```

## Tips

It is recommended that you create an alias for a specific language rather than
specifying it everytime in the command line arguments.

# Inserting documentation
The application uses the same format as zeal and Dash. Look at https://kapeli.com/docsets#dashDocset for more info.
