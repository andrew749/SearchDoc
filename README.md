# SearchDoc

Search documentation for a specific langauge.

Supports the same documentation formats that [Dash](kapeli.com/dash) and [Zeal](zealdoc.org)


## Usage

```
searchdoc QUERY [--language=LANG] [--method] [--class]
```

## Tips

It is recommended that you create an alias for a specific language rather than
specifying it everytime in the command line arguments.

# Inserting documentation
Look at
https://github.com/drbraden/pgdash/blob/master/pgdoc2set.py


Also https://kapeli.com/docsets#dashDocset so we can use the same format
